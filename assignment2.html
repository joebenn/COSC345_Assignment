    <h2>Assignment 2 - Draft System</h2>
    
    <h3>Progess Update</h3>
    
    <p>At this current stage we have created a basic emulator and thus began to test its capabilities and functionality. From here we can now begin to build our prototype application. For now our emulator has the ability to simulate a swipe left and right through the use of button clicks, this will eventually cycle through each weather system and displaying the correct information on screen, but currently each swipe holds a simple placeholder which identifies the difference between these screens. We’ve purposely decided to keep the emulator as simple as possible to avoid any potential errors caused by over complication. The result of this would be our emulator only allowing for left and right “swipes” on the screen. At this stage our app does not use the weather data yet, we will implement this as part of Assignment 3.  </p>
    
    <p>The group has continued to work well together with most of, if not all the work completed as a collaborative effort. Blake took charge with the creation of the emulator and Reuben was heavily involved in setting up the API use (which will be used in the app in the next development stage). Joe and Bayley helped in both areas where needed. Overall we feel we are a productive unit and are enjoying working together.</p>
    
    <h3>Testing</h3>
    
    <p>For testing we decided to make change in our original plan. Rather than using Firefox as initially proposed, we decided as a group to use the Google Chrome developer tools instead. Our change in debugging techniques was made because of experience in our group - all of us are more comfortable and used to the Chrome developing environment, this ultimately comes down to personal preference.</p>
    
    <h3>Any Changes</h3>
    
    <p>We initially chose to use Yahoo Weather as our choice of API, however after some thought we’ve collaboratively decided to change to Open Weather purely for the fact that it is much easier to access and use. This is the only significant change we have made that affects the build of the app. One thing that may change but has not yet is the design and visuals of the app, we would like to make out app visually pleasing and our currently mock designs could definitely be refactored/improved.</p>
    
    <h3>Revised Estimates</h3>
    
    <p>The whole design aspect of images and visuals of the app has been overlooked during the emulator development; this is something that will now be done alongside the production of the prototype application in Assignment 3.</p>
    
    <h3>Where to from here</h3>
    
    <p>Now we are in a position to begin putting our prototype application together. We will begin by using the data pulled from the Open Weather API, processing this and then displaying it, thus giving our app a purpose.</p>
